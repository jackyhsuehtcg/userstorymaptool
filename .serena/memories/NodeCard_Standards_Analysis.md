# NodeCard React Flow Standards Compliance Analysis

## Current Implementation Status
**Location**: `frontend/src/components/NodeCard.tsx` (74 lines)

### ✅ Compliant with React Flow Standards

1. **Proper Component Structure**
   - Uses React.FC<NodeCardProps> pattern ✓
   - Accepts standard NodeCardProps with `data` and `selected` ✓
   - Properly typed with TypeScript ✓

2. **Handle Implementation**
   - Uses Handle from '@xyflow/react' ✓
   - Implements both target (top) and source (bottom) handles ✓
   - Uses Position.Top and Position.Bottom from @xyflow/react ✓
   - Handles are placed correctly at component boundaries ✓

3. **Node Data Structure**
   - Follows React Flow convention: `data: { label: string; node: StoryMapNode }` ✓
   - Provides label property (expected by React Flow) ✓
   - Extends with custom node object for app-specific data ✓

4. **Selection Styling**
   - Accesses selected prop from React Flow correctly ✓
   - Applies selected class conditionally ✓
   - Expected pattern matches React Flow documentation examples ✓

5. **Node Registration**
   - Properly registered in Canvas.tsx: `const nodeTypes = { storyNode: NodeCard };` ✓
   - Custom type 'storyNode' correctly mapped ✓

### ⚠️ Missing Advanced Features (Optional)

1. **NodeResizer** - Not implemented
   - For resizable nodes with interactive handles
   - Not needed for current implementation
   - Can be added in future for task sizing

2. **NodeToolbar** - Not implemented
   - For context menus and floating actions
   - Current approach uses EditPanel sidebar instead
   - Alternative architectural choice

3. **useNodeConnections hook** - Not used
   - For accessing connected node information
   - Not required for current functionality
   - Could enhance advanced features later

4. **Event Handlers**
   - Missing onClick handler (handled by Canvas instead)
   - Missing onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave
   - Current centralized approach is valid

### Issues Found

**None Critical** - The implementation is fundamentally sound and follows React Flow standards correctly.

### Observations

1. **Props Structure**: Correctly implements NodeProps-like interface
   - Expects `data` object with app-specific content
   - Uses `selected` for visual feedback
   - This is the standard React Flow node component interface

2. **Handle Placement**: 
   - Top handle for incoming connections ✓
   - Bottom handle for outgoing connections ✓
   - Single target, single source is appropriate for tree structure ✓

3. **Styling Approach**:
   - Uses CSS classes (story-node-card) ✓
   - Should align with React Flow's expected structure ✓
   - External SCSS file for organization ✓

4. **Data Extraction**:
   - Safely extracts data.node for app properties ✓
   - Uses optional chaining for description and ticketLabels ✓
   - Proper null/undefined handling ✓

## Recommendations

1. **Current**: Keep as-is for basic tree operations ✅
2. **Enhancement**: Consider adding NodeResizer for future multi-level planning
3. **Future**: NodeToolbar could replace EditPanel for inline actions
4. **Best Practice**: Add React.memo() for performance optimization in large graphs

## Conclusion

The NodeCard component **IS FULLY COMPLIANT** with React Flow (xyflow) standard specifications. It correctly implements the custom node pattern as documented in React Flow examples. The implementation choices are appropriate for a story map tool and follow standard React Flow conventions.
